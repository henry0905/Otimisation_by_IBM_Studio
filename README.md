## Introduction

This project use the CPLEX solver of [IBM ILOG Optimization Studio](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio). It is linear programming solver, i.e. a software to solve linear optimization problems. Several types of solving algorithms are available, in particular the simplex algorithm. IBM ILOG also offers a second solver, IBM ILOG CP Optimizer, for constraint programming.

Two modes of use are available: via an API, allowing CPLEX to be interfaced using a programming language (such as JAVA, C++ or Python), and an interactive command line mode. During the session of this project, we will try to use both modes of use.

We use the OLP language, a high-level modeling language. This language has a declarative syntax close to the mathematical formulation of models. Ilog offers an Eclipse-based IDE for the OPL language.

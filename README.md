# Otimisation_by_IBM_Studio

This project use the CPLEX solver of [IBM ILOG Optimization Studio](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio). It is linear programming solver, i.e. a software to solve linear optimization problems. Several types of solving algorithms are available, in particular the simplex algorithm. IBM ILOG also offers a second solver, IBM ILOG CP Optimizer, for constraint programming.

Two modes of use are available: via an API, allowing CPLEX to be interfaced using a programming language (such as JAVA, C++ or Python), and an interactive command line mode. During the session of this TP, we will try to use both modes of use.
